   Mixed-Integer Programming Techniques for the Minimum Sum-of-Squares
   Clustering Problem
   by Jan Pablo Burgard, Carina Moreira Costa, Christopher Hojny,
   Thomas Kleinert, and Martin Schmidt.


I STEPS OF THE CODE

1. To run the program, enter
   "bin/kmeans.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT).$(LPS)
   (e.g. "bin/kmeans.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx2"). The first two arguments
   are mandatory and specify the file containing the set of data points and
   the number of clusters. An exemplary call is

   ./bin/kmeans.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx <path/to/instance> <number of clusters>

   Additional parameters can be:

   -s <setting file>
   -t <time limit>
   -m <mem limit>
   -n <node limit>
   -d <display frequency>

2. We assume that the sets of data points are encoded using the following format:

   The first row is 'npoints dimension' and encodes the number of points
   contained in set the instance file as well as the dimension of the ambient space.

   The remaining rows contain the coordinates of the points as a whitespace separated
   list.

   For example,

   4 2
   0 0
   0 1
   1 0
   1 1

   encodes the {0,1}-cube in dimension 2.

3. After reading the problem, an MINLP for computing an optimal cluster assigment
   is created and solved. Depending on the parameter setting, the quadratic
   or epigraph model is used as described in the article. By default, the
   epigraph model is used.


II PARAMETERS FOR SETTINGS FILES

There exist different parameters that can be used to change the behavior
of the code. The most important one is

clustering/model = value

which controls the method used to compute an optimal cluster assignment.
The following values encode the different models:

- 0: the quadratic model
- 1: the epigraph model without squared norms
- 2: the epigraph model

The remaining parameters control, i.a., how many OA cuts are used or
whether localized cardinality cuts are active. A list of all parameters
including a short description can be found in clusteringParams.c.
