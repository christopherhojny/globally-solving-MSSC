This file explains how to install the code, which has been used for the paper

   Mixed-Integer Programming Techniques for the Minimum Sum-of-Squares
   Clustering Problem
   by Jan Pablo Burgard, Carina Moreira Costa, Christopher Hojny,
   Thomas Kleinert, and Martin Schmidt.

Here is what you have to do to get the code running:

1a. Download CDD from https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib and install it. We assume
    that environment variables (pointing to)

    CDD_PATH (lib-src directory of cdd)
    CDD_LIB_PATH (library directory of cdd)

    have been set. When installing cddlib from github, these directories should
    be /path/to/cddlib-master/lib-src and /path/to/cddlib-master/lib-src/.libs,
    respectively.

1b. Download QHULL from http://www.qhull.org/ and install it. We assume that
    Qhull's lib directory has been added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2. Download SCIP from http://scip.zib.de. We recommend to use at least version 7.0.3,
   because the code has not been tested with older versions.

3. Install SCIP and compile it as described in the INSTALL file of SCIP's main
   directory with your individual settings. Make sure to create the necessary
   softlinks in SCIP's lib directory.

   To replicate the results from the above paper, we recommend to use the compilation
   command "make LPS=spx OPT=opt", i.e.,
   to use the following settings:
     (a) LPS=cpx: Use CPLEX as LP solver. For this you have to install CPLEX.
     (b) OPT=opt: The code is compiled in optimized mode and runs significantly
         faster.

   On some machines, you should use gmake instead of make.

4. Download the project from github. Probably you already did this if you read this file.

5. There are two options to determine the path to the SCIP directory:

   - Set the environment variable SCIP_PATH to contain the path to SCIP's root
     directory.

   - Edit the MAKEFILE of the directory computeRC, edit the
     variable SCIPDIR if necessary.  It should point to the directory
     that contains SCIP, i.e., $SCIPDIR/lib contains the SCIP library files.

6. Compile the project: In the main directory, enter exactly the same compilation
   command as used in Step 2.

7. To run the program, enter
   "bin/kmeans.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT).$(LPS)"
   (e.g., "bin/kmeans.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx2"). The first two arguments
   are mandatory and specify the file containing the set of data points and
   the number of clusters. An exemplary call is

   ./bin/kmeans.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx <path/to/instance> <number of clusters>

   Additional parameters can be:

   -s <setting file>
   -t <time limit>
   -m <mem limit>
   -n <node limit>
   -d <display frequency>
